## 🐱 About Seth

Seth is a former street cat who used to live in our neighborhood. When we first moved in, Seth would sleep in our front door during the night and roam around the neighborhood during the day, until one day we officially adopted him and taken care of him since. This site is a tribute to his journey, his quirks, and the joy he brings us every day.
